// ASSESSMENT 2: Coding Critique with AI

// Enter the following prompt into ChatGPT or similar AI tool.

// Prompt: Create a function that takes in a string and logs the index of the first vowel.

// Copy and paste the code output here.

// def find_first_vowel_index(input_string):
//     vowels = "AEIOUaeiou"  # Define a string containing all possible vowels
//     for i, char in enumerate(input_string):
//         if char in vowels:
//             return i  # Return the index of the first vowel found
//     return -1  # Return -1 if no vowel is found in the string

// # Example usage:
// input_string = "Hello, World!"
// index = find_first_vowel_index(input_string)
// if index != -1:
//     print(f"The index of the first vowel in the string is: {index}")
// else:
//     print("No vowels found in the string.")

// Critique the code output. 
// Things to consider in your critique: Were you surprised by the output? Was the output what you expected? Is the correct output being rendered? What do you like about the code? What do you dislike? Are there best practices that are not being followed? Would you take a different approach? What did you learn? 

//First, I noticed that the code is not javascript. I didn't think about what possible output I might get. I did not expect the output to be written in javascript because the prompt did not specify any coding language. I am suprised that I can understand this and follow the code. The code defines what a vowel is. It checks the value at i and if there is a vowel, it returns that value, otherwise , return is -1 if not a vowel. I am guessing "print" is similar to "console.log()". If a vowel is present, the code uses string interpolation to add the index to the string/message it returns. If no vowel is present, it retrurns only a string, "No vowels found in the string."
// I learned that when using AI, we must be very specific. It is only a tool to assist us in research and to assist us in writing code. It is a vluable tool if we use it with caution.
